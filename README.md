easyBenchmarkTesttool
=====================

### Introduction:
a general benchmark test tool depends on tornado's feature of high-performance framework based on epoll module,asynchronous httpclient,multi-process,and the python plotting package matplotlib,numpy for matlab 2D graphics.http protocol of get and post is supported current version,the project is still in development for the extend of gernal protocol,please pay attention to continuous update follwed-up.

### Feature:
* this client test tool could easily achieve a high level of pressure with small count of CPU and memory resources.
* with a small scale of source code,extension will be easy to achieve.
* relatively perfect output of statistics and graphics
